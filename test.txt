A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and the sea. The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the wider body of seawater.
Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea),
or certain large, nearly landlocked bodies of water.

The salinity of water bodies varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean;
however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans. The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride.
The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury,
amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations.


The ocean moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles.
The surface of water interacts with the atmosphere, exchanging properties such as particles and temperature,
as well as currents. Surface currents are the water currents that are produced by the atmosphere's currents and its winds
blowing over the surface of the water, producing wind waves, setting up through drag slow but stable circulations of water,
as in the case of the ocean sustaining deep-sea ocean currents. Deep-sea currents, known together as the global conveyor belt,
carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean and significantly influence Earth's climate. Tides,
the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the Moon and,
to a lesser extent, of the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries.
Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis,
as can volcanoes, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites.

Fresh water production
Desalination is the technique of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.[195]

Marine pollution
Main article: Marine pollution
Many substances enter the sea as a result of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited into the sea by precipitation. Industrial outflows and sewage contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, household cleaning products and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects.[216] The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium and zinc which may be bio-accumulated by marine organisms and are passed up the food chain.[217]
